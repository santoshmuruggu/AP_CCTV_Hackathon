# 📹 Anomaly Video Processor & Streamlit Dashboard

This project provides a complete pipeline for **video data extraction** and **dashboard visualization**.  
It includes a `video_processor.py` script that processes surveillance or warehouse videos and stores extracted information into a database, and a `Streamlit` app to visualize and retrieve that data.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🧠 AI-powered video frame processing (e.g., for anomaly detection, object tracking)
- 📦 Automatic extraction and logging from video files
- 💾 Data stored into a structured database
- 📊 Real-time dashboard using Streamlit
